🚢 Titanic Data Visualization Project

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
It includes multiple visualizations, insights, and a comparison of both libraries — presented through a structured Jupyter Notebook.

📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze the Titanic passenger dataset and visualize patterns related to:

Survival rates
Passenger demographics
Class distribution
Age patterns
Gender-based comparisons

The notebook contains:

Cleaned dataset
Individual plots using Matplotlib
Individual plots using Seaborn
Markdown explanations
Observations and conclusions

🔧 Technologies Used

Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook

📊 Matplotlib Visualizations Included

The notebook contains the following Matplotlib plots:

Line Plot
Bar Plot
Scatter Plot
Histogram
Box Plot
Pie Chart
Stacked Bar Chart
Area Plot

Each visualization is applied to relevant Titanic features.

🎨 Seaborn Visualizations Included

Seaborn plots used in the project:

Countplot
Histogram (displot)
Boxplot
Violinplot
Heatmap
Pairplot
Scatterplot (relplot)
Barplot

All visuals are customized to highlight survival patterns and demographic insights.
